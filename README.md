# AI Trend Predictor Smart Contract

This repository contains the **AI Trend Predictor** smart contract written in Solidity. The contract cycles through predefined AI-generated trend predictions each time it is updated.

## Features
- **Predict AI Trends**: Provides AI-driven trend predictions stored on the blockchain.
- **No Inputs Required**: The contract updates predictions automatically upon calling the update function.
- **Stored on Edu Chain**: Ensures decentralization and immutability.
- **Public Prediction Data**: Anyone can view the latest prediction and timestamp.

## Deployment Details
- **Smart Contract Address**: `0x22Eb8546521cA4C6587A7467FFdc0C4Fb263f72F`
- **Blockchain**: Edu Chain

## How It Works
1. The contract stores a list of predefined AI-generated predictions.
2. Calling `updatePrediction()` updates the prediction to the next one in the list.
3. The latest prediction and its timestamp are publicly accessible.

This project is open-source and available for anyone to use and improve.
